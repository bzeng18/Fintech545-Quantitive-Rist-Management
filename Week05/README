Run cells one by one in jupyter notebook. The notebook is written in Python and need to install all the packages first. To install the ft545 package which I created by myself, run pip install ../lib/dist/ft545-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl firs. All test cases are in test folder under lib. To run test cases, run python setup.py pytest. Make sure to install wheel,setuptools,twine,pytest and pytest-runner first.
